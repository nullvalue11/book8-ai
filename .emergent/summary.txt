The previous AI engineer's work primarily revolved around stabilizing and extending the Book8 AI application. This involved an initial Build Warnings Cleanup phase, tackling  warnings,  optimization, and fixing UI hydration mismatches on the dashboard, which proved to be a persistent layout issue. A significant feature, the AI Assistant MVP (Phase D), was implemented, introducing new UI and API endpoints, along with rule-based parsing, rate limiting, and telemetry. However, this feature's integration introduced new build failures related to  usage and, more critically, Module not found errors due to inconsistent path aliases for UI components. The engineer spent a considerable amount of time troubleshooting and attempting to fix these module resolution issues, cycling between relative imports and a project-wide alias configuration. The work was passed on during the initial stages of a new Brand Logo Integration task, where new logo assets were just being incorporated.

<product_requirements>
Book8 AI is an AI integration service for small businesses, offering scheduling, real-time voice, web search, and platform integrations. The existing MVP, built with Next.js/TypeScript/Node.js and MongoDB, includes JWT authentication, booking CRUD operations, Stripe billing, and two-way Google Calendar OAuth synchronization, supported by external cron jobs. Recent enhancements expanded to include Tavily Live Web Search, detailed Billing Activity Logs (with user/admin APIs and UI), a secure Password Reset Flow using Resend, and refined Google Calendar integration with improved routing, persistence, and event syncing. A toggleable Dark Theme and a comprehensive Public Booking Link (Phase A) were also implemented, providing user availability management, GCal event creation, ICS email attachments, and links for booking cancellation/rescheduling. A UI redesign with new branding was also completed. Phase B further advanced the Public Booking Link with secure rescheduling via one-time tokens and guest timezone support, alongside rate-limiting, telemetry, and feature flags. Environmental hardening (type-safe  and  refactoring) and critical bug fixes were also part of this phase. The application also includes an AI Booking Assistant (Phase D), which provides a chat UI, rule-based parsing for scheduling intents, dual-timezone slot cards, and booking confirmation modals, with feature flags for optional LLM integration.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing a critical build failure stemming from Module not found errors related to import aliases, specifically for  and . This has been a recurring issue, with the engineer attempting multiple fixes, including switching between relative paths and re-establishing a project-wide alias configuration.

Most recently, the engineer has implemented a comprehensive alias solution across , , and  to ensure  resolves correctly to  and includes legacy compatibility for . A new ESLint rule  has been added to prevent future use of the deprecated  alias. The engineer has also performed repo-wide replacements to convert legacy  imports to the canonical  form.

Simultaneously, the engineer has just begun a new major task: feat/brand-logo-integration. This involves replacing all temporary/placeholder logos with new Book8-AI brand assets. The initial step for this task has been completed by adding the provided logo assets (SVG, PNG, ICO files) to the  directory and beginning to update  metadata for favicon, OpenGraph, and Twitter images. The immediate problem is still resolving the module resolution issues from the previous tasks while beginning the branding integration.
